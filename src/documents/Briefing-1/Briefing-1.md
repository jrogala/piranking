## Hot topic

### First community event ever for PiRanking

First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to all of you for making this event possible. Your participation in PiRanking since its inception has been instrumental in fostering a thriving Assetto Corsa community.

This event marks a significant milestone for many of you, so I'd like to provide some guidelines to ensure that you have an enjoyable experience:

- Drive within your limits. Avoid pushing your car to the point of losing control during the event. The races are most enjoyable when everyone can cross the finish line without incident.
- Strike a balance. While it's important to be competitive, avoid overcommitting and getting involved in unnecessary collisions.
- Embrace the spirit of racing. Remember that this is a racing event, so don't shy away from engaging in close battles on the track.
- Don't stress about performance. Even if you're not setting record lap times, you can still have a great time. There will always be someone to compete with, even if it's yourself for the majority of a race.

### Pit lane exit

Please take note of the pitlane exit and adhere to the following guidelines:

- Do not cross the white line under any circumstances. Cars are traveling at speeds of up to 250 km/h on the red line, while you will be at 150 km/h on the blue line. Moving into the path of a car on a hot lap can lead to a dangerous collision. If possible, delay your move onto the racing line until you are certain that no one is approaching.

### Rules

Rules are shared on the rule book sent previously. It is important that all participants have read and understood the rules, as they provide valuable knowledge for online racing.

In summary, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Avoid desperate overtakes. Maintain a level-headed approach and prioritize safety.
- Do not make sudden movements under braking. Give other drivers space and avoid causing unnecessary collisions.
- Look for suitable opportunities to overtake. Trying to overtake at Turn 1 may lead to undesirable consequences for example.
- Respect the blue flag. If you are being lapped, allow the faster car to pass safely. Note that this rule may change in future events.
- If you accidentally spin another car, it is considered respectful to wait for them to recover before continuing.

Let's ensure a fair and enjoyable racing experience for everyone involved.

Have a good race and have fun!
