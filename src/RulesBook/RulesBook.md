# Rule Book PiRanking

## Nature of Event

### Open Lobby

Open lobbies are servers accessible without restrictions. Anyone can join and race, with no prerequisite requirements. Since rules from this Rule Book are not enforced here, three key points arise:
- You are responsible for not being disruptive. Remember, in non-toxic crashes, responsibility is often shared.
- Only toxic behavior (reckless driving, deliberate crashing, chicane cutting, brake checking, etc.) is subject to a ban. Minor infractions like closing the door while braking in a turn do not warrant a ban, although they might be penalized elsewhere.
- Anticipate potentially toxic behavior from nearby drivers. After overtaking, protect the inside line and communicate your intentions clearly. Sometimes, a feigned move can safely open a path for both parties. (see Vortex of Danger, you are responsible for not creating it.)

### Open

Open races are fun events held regularly for beginners, advanced, and confirmed drivers. While the standard rules are not as stringently enforced as in championship races, adherence to this Rule Book and fair racing practices are recommended.
- You are expected to be the responsible party here. If a crash occurs due to a missed braking point, lock-up, etc., you should let the affected driver pass and exercise greater caution subsequently.
- No penalties will be issued, but malicious behavior should be reported. Knowledge of racing techniques, the vehicle, and the track is expected before joining an Open server.
- When encountering a slower driver, assume they may be a beginner. Avoid aggressive maneuvers like dive bombing or driving in an intimidating manner. If you're faster, a natural opportunity for overtaking will present itself.

### Championship

Championship races consist of multiple events tailored for advanced and confirmed drivers. Adherence to the rules is mandatory, and the Rule Book must be followed.
- Your responsibility is to maintain respectfulness, not necessarily kindness. For instance, in the event of a collision due to a lock-up, do not wait for the other driver, even if you are at fault. Penalties, such as drive-throughs, will be issued for such incidents. If you do wait, ensure you're not obstructing the track. Competitive conduct is expected.
- Penalties will be applied. Clean driving, thorough knowledge of the race and track, and car handling are expected.
- Competitors should not be beginners. This means being capable of safely overtaking and being overtaken.

## Rules

The rules outlined here are not exhaustive. They are based on real-life semi-professional racing guidelines. Remember, you are not an F1 driver who can exploit every rule for a competitive edge.

### Passing (Based on SCCA Rules)
1. **Responsibility for Passing**: The car attempting to overtake holds primary responsibility for a safe pass. This means ensuring a safe and successful maneuver without causing a collision or forcing the lead car off the track.

2. **Peripheral Vision Rule**: The overtaking car must be visible in the peripheral vision of the lead car in the brake zone before the corner. This visibility is crucial for safe passing maneuvers.

3. **Overlap Rules for Open Wheel and Sports Racers**: The front tire of the overtaking car should align with at least the rear tire of the lead car before cornering. The overtaken car must clearly understand the overtaking car's intent.

4. **Blind Spot Awareness**: Overtaking in the blind spot is discouraged unless the lead car has provided adequate room. This is to prevent collisions due to the lead car being unaware of the overtaking car's presence.

5. **Providing Racing Room**: Both cars must maintain sufficient space on the track to ensure safe racing conditions.

6. **Passing on Straights**: The lead car may make one safe defensive move on straights but must ensure there is enough room for a safe pass by the trailing car.

7. **Continuous Overlap into Corners**: In cases of continuous overlap, the lead car must maintain its line and leave adequate space for the trailing car, even after completing the turn.

8. **Avoiding the Vortex of Danger**: High-risk areas near the apex and track-out points of a corner should be approached with caution. These areas are especially risky for passing maneuvers.

9. **Outside Passing**: When overtaking on the outside, the overtaking car must ensure visibility and avoid the Exit Vortex of Danger to prevent accidents.

### Flags (Based on FFSA Rules)
**Blue Flag:** ![Blue flag](src/RulesBook/image-8.png)

The blue flag signals slower drivers to prepare for an imminent overtake. Facilitate the pass for faster cars without compromising your own race. This typically involves sticking to the racing line, braking slightly earlier, and enabling an easy pass.

- **During Practice**: Yield to faster cars preparing to overtake. They should find an optimal spot for the maneuver without disrupting your practice.
- **During Qualifying**: 
    - **Outlap/Inlap/Slowlap/Missed Lap**: You MUST allow qualifying cars to proceed unhindered. Clear the racing line and, if needed, stop until you can safely rejoin without affecting others.
    - **Fastlap**: Overtaking should only occur if it doesnâ€™t impede the current lap. If the blue flag car isn't fast enough, create a sufficient gap before attempting another lap.
- **During Sprint Races**: Allow cars at least one lap ahead to overtake.

**Yellow Flag:** ![Yellow flag](src/RulesBook/image-9.png)

The yellow flag indicates impending danger on the track.
- Reduce speed and refrain from overtaking. Be ready for sudden directional changes. Overtaking is STRICTLY prohibited.
- Failing to slow down and exacerbating the situation (e.g., colliding with slower or crashed cars) may result in disqualification from the current event, among other penalties. Speed reduction is imperative.

### Vocal
- Voice communication is mandatory for the event.
- Mumble software must be pre-installed and tested before the event.
Further details will follow. (link, instructions)

### Briefing
- Attending the briefing is compulsory for server access.
- A password-protected link will be provided during the briefing.
- Topics covered include track specifics, safety car rules, general advice, and a final software check for each participant.

### Mandatory Software/Required Hardware
- Assetto Corsa, Mumble, CSP 1.79 or newer, and Real Penalty are required.
- Radar app, J-fuel, ProTyre are strongly recommended.
- A minimum of 10 training laps is mandatory.
- Participants should be adequately prepared for the event.
- Hardware must be sufficient to handle the race. The event will not accommodate individual network/software issues, except in the case of server-side problems.

### Penalty/Report
Penalty enforcement will be as follows:
- Verbal warning for aggressive behavior.
- Warning for dangerous behavior, typically resulting in a post-race time penalty.
- Drive-Through penalty for causing an accident through dangerous behavior.
- Session bans for causing an accident due to reckless or toxic driving.

Reporting procedures are as follows:
- Voice reports should be made to race control during the race. Post-race reports are also accepted after replay review.
- Race control may not address all in-race reports, especially first-lap incidents.
- All post-race reports must be acknowledged by race control.
- In-race reports should be immediate and concise: "Driver xxx caused contact at turn 3, lap 3."
- Race control will announce penalties globally.
- You have the right to request a review of any in-race penalties.
- Race control reserves the right to mute disruptive or false reporting during the race. Muted drivers must wait until race end to report.
